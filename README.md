# npm-scripts
Contains a single package.json file that has some NPM scripts. These scripts were originally taken from [this Pluralsight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/npm-build-tool-introduction/exercise-files) and modified slightly by me.

Most likely you will have to modify these scripts slightly or remove some completely.
